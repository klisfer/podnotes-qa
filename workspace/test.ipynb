      "['On his third appearance on the podcast, Dr. Barlow speaks with Max Tegmark about artificial intelligence and why it\\'s important to have the right kind of people around you in order to be a good human being. The show is brought to you by Indeed, which also sponsors the show. Indeed gives you access to its suite of tools including an AI tool called notion, which allows you to write better, smarter, more complex essays faster than anyone else ever has. In addition, you can do all sorts of other cool stuff with it like create presentations, make notes, edit documents, etc. On top of this, there\\'s the notion AI tool, which lets you combine large language models into a productivity note-taking device. You can use it for anything from note taking to working on big projects to tracking your health or finding out about new job opportunities. Afterward, they talk about whether there might actually be intelligent life in the universe. He thinks there probably is, but that we need to keep some distance between ourselves and the rest of the universe if we want to enjoy the benefits of science and technology. Also, he says, we don\\'t necessarily need to stop using big data analysis--in fact, the best decisions about our lives should be based on the things that come from our own self-tracking devices. For example, someone like InsideTracker, which analyzes your blood and body measurements to give you recommendations about how to live a healthier lifestyle, should be done regularly. And speaking of OutsideTrack, which uses machine learning to predict changes in biological markers over time, shouldn\\'t be done just once in a given period of time. What\\'s most important to him is having the right sort of team: If you\\'re looking to find a job at Indeed, go to Indeed.com/lax. Finally, the discussion turns to the rise of artificial intelligence. Do you think there are intelligent alien civilizations out there? Yes, he thinks there are. They\\'ll be much more alien than a cat or even the most exotic animal because they won\\'t have gone through the usual Darwinian competition where everybody cares about self-preservation, fear of death, etc.; instead, they\\'ll be more naturalistic. How does he know this? Well, he\\'s worked with Chad GPT, one of the pioneering neural networks used by Microsoft, which was designed to help mothers teach their kids how to write high school graduation speeches to their graduating class. Now, though, he wants to explore how humans communicate with these distant beings. More specifically, he talks about what he learned from his parents when they died. Mostly, he got his fascination for math from his dad, but mostly his obsession for consciousness came from his mom. Another thing he took from both of them was the ability not to buy into what everybody else was saying. That\\'s why he\\'s so happy to hear that you\\'re at the top of your field and still able to tackle the big questions in your own way. As far as he\\'s concerned, it\\'s admirable that you remain completely independent rather than following the advice of others. Unfortunately, losing his parents made him question everything; it makes him less afraid of other people telling him he\\'s an idiot. It helps him focus on what matters to him. Next, he discusses his current project, which is building an artificial intelligence that could replace not only its software but also its hardware. He calls it \"the most important fork the humanity has reached in its over 100,000 years on the planet\" and wonders if it will either be the best thing ever to happen to humanity or the worst. Later, he suggests that maybe they should pause the development of these systems until they figure out how to make sure they work safely. Again, he refers back to the case of Don\\'t Look Up, a movie about an artist building an advanced race of birds before realizing they need to build an entire race of machines first. Basically, he sees this as similar to constructing an advanced aircraft, except instead of building an old extinct race of insects, they\\'re building an entirely new race of smart ones. Then he brings up the idea of rebranding ourselves as \"Homo sapiens,\" thinking of ourselves as the smartest people on earth. Right now, he argues, we\\'ve started to think of ourselves simply as the fittest people on Earth, but someday, perhaps, we\\'ll look down on those who aren\\'t smart enough to reach the same level of intelligence as us. Ultimately, he feels that replacing experience with information processing with value adds another level of value to what it means to be human. Of course, this doesn\\'t mean we should abandon the pursuit of knowledge altogether, but let\\'s try to share ideas with others.']\n"
